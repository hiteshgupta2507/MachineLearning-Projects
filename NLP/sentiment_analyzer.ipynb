    "##### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "It is a process of determining the sentiment of a given piece of text. For example it can be used to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. It is frequently used to analyze marketing campaigns, opinion polls, social media presence, product reviews on e-commerce sites, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ue a Naive Bayes classifier to build this classifier. We first need to extract all tge unique words from the text. The NLTK classifier needs this data to be arranged in the form of a dictionary so that it can ingest it. Once we divide the text data into training anf testing datasets, we will train the Naive Bayes classifier to classify the reviews into positive and negative. We will also print out the top informative words to indicate positive and negative reviews. This information is interesting because it tells us what words ar ebeing used to denote various reactions.
